**Group Members:**  
Joy Wamaitha • Susan Apiyo • Sarah Sindet • Cynthia Mungai

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting Netflix stock prices using time series techniques. We used historical data (2002–2025), cleaned and engineered features, and implemented a hybrid model combining LSTM and XGBoost for better accuracy.

> **Duration:** March 26, 2025 – April 2, 2025  
> **Dataset:** Historical Netflix stock data
> **Goal:** Predict future stock prices to aid investors in making data-driven decisions.

## Techniques Used
- Data cleaning & feature engineering
- Time series modeling with LSTM
- XGBoost modeling
- Hybrid model architecture
- Hyperparameter tuning (Keras Tuner & GridSearchCV)
- SHAP for model explainability
- Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, R²
